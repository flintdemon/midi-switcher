# midi-switcher
This is a small Arduino project for switching a guitar amp channel using a midi command (from a guitar processor, for example). Designed for amplifiers that do not have built-in midi control. The classic Arduino scheme is used. As a switch, you a use a transistor in the key mode or a relay. Full layout of the board in a .lay file.
